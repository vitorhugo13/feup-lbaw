# A2: Actors and User stories
This document describes actors, user stories and additional requirements for our collaborative Q&A platform - **LAMA**.  
**LAMA** is a website that allows users to propose questions to each other, about their individual circumstances and experiences, or inversely, to expose one's particular situation and allow others to question them.


## 1. Actors
For the __LAMA__ system, the actors are represented and described in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively.
