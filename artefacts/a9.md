# A9: Product

**Literally Ask Me Anything**, a.k.a **LAMA**,  is a website that allows users to propose questions to each other, about their individual circumstances and experiences, or inversely, to expose one's particular situation and allow others to question them. Our main goal is to create a **clean**, **minimalist** and **useful** platform, allowing all participants to have a great experience.

**LAMA** is a forum-like website where anyone can freely browse through posts. After a user logs in, he/she can propose a topic by creating a post, so others can ask questions about it by commenting on the post. Furthermore, if a user demonstrates a good reputation, it can be promoted to Moderator by the website admins. Once this happens, the user gains the right to review reports and help managing toxic content.

This way, we hope **LAMA** to be a safe breeding ground for empathy, awareness and tolerance.

## 1. Installation

To run our website locally simple clone the repository (link [here](https://git.fe.up.pt/lbaw/lbaw1920/lbaw2031/-/tree/A9)) and run the following command on the root of the repository:

```
sudo docker run -it -p 8000:80 -e DB_DATABASE="lbaw2031" -e DB_USERNAME="lbaw2031" -e DB_PASSWORD="VN319989" lbaw2031/lbaw2031
```

## 2. Usage

## 3. Application Help

We consider our application quite intuitive and for that reasons not a lot of application help was implemented.  Despite that, we thought it would be good to add two tooltips in less intuitive forms. One can be viewed in the post creation/edit form, in the category choice dropdown. The other is in the profile page, explaining how a user's glory works.

## 4. Input Validation

Regarding input validation, we chose to use both client-side validation and server-side validation.

For data such as passwords in the register, entering email, as well as mandatory fields, HTML input validation is used. The following image shows an example on the register page:

Still regarding client side, JavaScript validation is still used, for example present whenever a blocked user tries to contest and does not write anything as a justification.

On the server side, whenever we receive something from forms or requests, the data is checked by validators. Some are quite complex, such as the request fields on a block request:

## 6. HTML & CSS Validation

All CSS was validated. All errors are related to the use of variables that are defined in a different file and, as such, are not recognized by the validator. Warnings are mostly related to the use of browser specific instructions.

Regarding HTML validation, 11 pages were validated resulting in only a warning in one of them.

The results are present in more detail on the delivery zip.

## 7. Revisions to the Project
Since the requirements specification stage some things have been changed, from user stories to business rules.

User stories related to notifications and authentication using API were not implemented, since we had to adapt to our time limitations.
Some bussiness rules were also modified or removed:
 * BR06: Deleted Account Activity - the only difference from the previous specification of this rule is related to upvotes and downvotes, these are now deleted when a user account is removed.
 * BR10: Block Notifications - Since we were not able to implement the notification logic, this business rule could not be followed.
 * BR13: Vote on own content - During the development of the website we decided that this rule was not relevant, since most other platforms allow this to happen and the vote of one single user will not influence the success of his/hers post in a significant way.
 * BR16: Category Assignment - Many of our report reasons are focused on the code of conduct, thus it's not as important that the moderator has a good understanding of the category.

## 8. Implementation Details

### 8.1. Libraries Used

**Packages**
* *Carbon*: used to handle dates when we need to block a user or remove his block when the time comes.
* *Php7.2-gd*: for using images in the project
* *Intervention image*: crop images when they are introduced into the system

## Disclaimer
For some reason, the reset password feature only works locally, never when running on the production machine or the image present in the production locally. The following image shows the associated error, so we deduce that for security reasons, since we are using vpn, the connection is not allowed.
