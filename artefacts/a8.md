# A8: Vertical prototype

**LAMA** is a website that allows users to propose questions to each other, about their individual circumstances and experiences, or inversely, to expose one's particular situation and allow others to question them. Our main goal is to create a **clean**, **minimalist** and **useful** platform, allowing all participants to have a great experience.
 
As stated in our restrictions, our project had to be built using the Laravel framework, and include the different layers encompassing our architecture, that is, the user interface, business logic and the various data access permissions. Therefore, this prototype includes a first implementation of various types of pages from our website, including visualization, insertion, editing and removing information. Access to these pages is also controlled though the various levels of permissions a user can have.
