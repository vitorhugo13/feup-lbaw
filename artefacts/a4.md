# A4: Conceptual Data Model

**LAMA** is a website that allows users to propose questions to each other, about their individual circumstances and experiences, or inversely, to expose one's particular situation and allow others to question them. Our main goal is to create a **clean**, **minimalist** and **useful** platform, allowing all participants to have a great experience.

This artefact aims to expose the UML class diagram representative of our platform, as well as exposing new business rules found in the development of this artefact.

## 1. Class diagram

For a better understanding of the problem domain, an UML class diagram is used. The diagram in Figure 1 shows the domain entities, their attributes and domains. It is also possible to observe their associations and their multiplicity with other entities.

Figure 1: UML conceptual data model

In the UML there were two additional domains used:
1. Motives (in *Notification*), that denotes the enumeration {'Block', 'New Comment', 'Rating', 'Content Deleted', 'Community Post'};
2. Reasons (in *Report*), that denotes the enumeration {'Offensive', 'Spam', 'Harassment', 'Sexually Explicit', 'Violent', 'Terrorism', 'Repulsive', 'Harmful', 'Wrong Category'}.

## 2. Additional Business Rules

| **Identifier** | **Name** | **Description** |

| ABR01 | Disabled Notifications | If a user disables notifications of a given content, while they are disabled the notifications are not registered/saved. |
| ABR02 | Top Category Admission | A category is only admissible as Top Category if the user has positive glory on it. |
| ABR03 | Profile Top Categories | A user can have at most 3 Top Categories. |
| ABR04 | Contest Revision | The contest of a report has to be reviewed by a moderator other than the one that reviewed the report in the first place. |
| ABR05 | Only One Contest | A report can only be contested once. |
| ABR06 | Star Own Content | A user cannot star his/hers own post. |
| ABR07 | Downvote and Upvote | A user cannot simultaneously upvote and downvote the same content. |
