# A3: User Interface Prototype

**LAMA** is a website that allows users to propose questions to each other, about their individual circumstances and experiences, or inversely, to expose one's particular situation and allow others to question them. Our main goal is to create a **clean**, **minimalist** and **useful** platform, allowing all participants to have a great experience.

This user interface prototype (horizontal prototype) has 3 main goals:
1. Review and discover new user stories as the actual platform is designed;
2. Preview and test the user interface of the final product;
3. Iterate over the design of the user interface.

This way we can preview our platform's look and further analyze the user's requirements as we develop the interface he/she will be using.

This artefact is divided into 4 main sections:
* **Interface and common features** - exposure of common elements and layout on most pages.
* **Sitemap** - overview of the website's navigation between pages.
* **Storyboards** - demonstration of interactions with the system.
* **Interfaces** - list of most pages on the platform.

## 1. Interface and common features
**LAMA** is a collection of web pages developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript technology. In our assistance, the BootStrap framework was also used to implement user interfaces. The following figures identifies common elements on most of the pages.

Figure 1: Shows the common elements to most of our pages (desktop on the left and mobile on the right).

**1.** Logo
**2.** Search bar
**3.** Navbar 
**4.** Sidebar
**5.** Page content
**6.** Footer

* The platform is entirely based on a responsive design, that is, it is able to adjust, without losing functionality, to various types of screens such as desktop, tablets and mobile.
* During the entire use of our services, the user always has at his disposal, on all pages (except Log In and Register) a header and a footer, so he can easily access all pages and take full advantage our platform.



## 2. Sitemap

The following picture shows our page structure, revealing our intention to keep navigation as horizontal as possible in the platform.

## 3. Storyboards
The following figures present the storyboards - representation of main features using a sequence of interfaces.
