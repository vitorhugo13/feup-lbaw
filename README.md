## Product presentation

**Literally Ask Me Anything**, a.k.a **LAMA**, is a website that allows users to propose questions to each other, about their individual circumstances and experiences, or inversely, to expose one's particular situation and allow others to question them. Our main goal is to create a **clean**, **minimalist** and **useful** platform, allowing all participants to have a great experience.

**LAMA** is a forum-like website where anyone can freely browse through posts. After a user logs in, he/she can propose a topic by creating a post, so others can ask questions about it by commenting on the post. Furthermore, if a user demonstrates a good reputation, it can be promoted to Moderator by the website admins. Once this happens, the user gains the right to review reports and help managing toxic content.

This way, we hope **LAMA** to be a safe breeding ground for empathy, awareness and tolerance.
